## Why?

Visualizations are a key tool in the analysis of data. Relative comparison of performance indicators, identifying patterns and trends present in data etc. tasks can be done much more easily using visual indicators compared to numerical data representation.

### widgets

Visualizations allow the users to easily perform comparisons and help in identifying patterns or trends present in the data. However static visualizations fail to provide the flexibility to the users who would like to perform analysis dynamically based on user input. Widgets in Python support flexible data analysis by allowing the users to interact with visualization elements and help in dynamically updating the data that is driving the visualizations.



## How?

Python provides several visualization libraries, and Altair is one of the latest additions to this list. Though some other libraries offer more flexibility and complexity in visual design â€“ the ease of use, intuitive methodology, and the relatively easy learning curve makes Altair library one of the best solutions for quick visualizations and analysis.        

IPYwidgets in Python can be used to allow users of jupyter notebooks to easily interact with certain visualization elements as needed. For example, a user can select the range of year and region using dropdowns in IPYwidgets to limit and focus the analysis on a certain period and a country.      

Some example charts, widgets, and the code behind charts can be found in the notebooks section of this repository.
